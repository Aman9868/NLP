    "paragraph=\"\"\"CoVID-19 started infecting people in the city of Wuhan, China in mid-December of 2019. Within a month, more than ten thousand people were infected and hundreds had died. The death rate was about 16% in the first two weeks but reduced to about 4% by mid-February and currently stands at about 2%. The initial outbreak caused many people to die who would have survived if they had received medical treatment. Unfortunately, the Wuhan medical system was unable to treat the extremely large number of seriously ill people seeking help. Simply put, the large number of seriously ill people greatly exceeded hospital capacity. Consequently, many people who needed basic care for dehydration and fever could not find care. China now reports a death rate of 0.7% outside of Hubei Province.\n",
    "A death rate of 2% is about 13 times greater than the incidence of death from seasonal flu. During the last flu season, 2018/2019, CDC reports 35 million Americans caught the flu and about 56,000 people died establishing a death rate of 0.15%. If the same number of Americans, 35 million, became infected with CoVID-19 and the death rate was actually 2%, CoVID-19 could be responsible for 700,000 deaths. However, there are several reasons to believe that the death rate is much less than 2%.\n",
    "As of 10 March 2020, when this essay was prepared, there were about 100,000 confirmed cases and about 4,000 deaths for a death rate of 4% (but this includes the data from Wuhan). Data from many countries now reporting show that about 80% of infected people experience mild to moderate symptoms. It is likely that a large number of infected people with mild or very mild symptoms are not represented in the data because they never felt sick. The missing cases skew the death rate towards a higher rate. So, the 2% death rate is probably high due to the “non reports” of people simply not accounted for in the data.\n",
    "Th U.S. will not see anything like what happened in Wuhan, China for the following reasons: 1) our medical systems are prepared to some extent, we hope; 2) individually, we have had time to prepare; 3) the symptoms and infection vector of CoVID-19 is well fairly-well understood; and, 4) our collective understanding of the threat and hygiene vigilance will slow the spread putting less stress on our health systems.\n",
    "Regardless of what you have heard — even the President telling people it is ok to go to work — we should prepare for a possible mandatory or voluntary 14 day quarantine. This requires at least 14 days imprisoned in your house. It is possible or likely that your office building, place of work, church, your children’s school or other group activities will be cancelled or closed for a period of time. It is more probable than not that you will be exposed to CoVID-19 in the near future.\n",
    "All viruses are composed of a small piece of DNA, RNA or both. You remember DNA, the stuff made from nucleic acids, Crick and Watson, “double-helix”. As you remember, it is the memory bank that holds all the information necessary to make you — YOU. A virus is a short piece of DNA or RNA, or both wrapped inside a protein shell sometimes called an envelope, or just “enclosure structure”. The shape of the envelope is quite diverse and can be very complex.\n",
    "Some viruses are very “sticky” and remain in spittle and adhere to surfaces like your hand or the deli countertop. You are exposed to sticky viruses when an infected person sneezes or coughs on you. There are thousands or millions of viruses in the water/mucus droplets (aka, “spittle”) expelled in a sneeze or cough. You are also exposed if you touch a surface where infected spittle landed like the movie theater candy counter. Some viruses are not sticky but can float in the air after being released in a sneeze or cough. As you could imagine, these are much more contagious than the sticky kind.\n",
    "Viruses do not have the capacity to reproduce by themselves. They duplicate by drilling through the membrane of a living cell and inserting their piece of DNA, RNA or both into that living cell. Since there are about 6 gazillion cells inside each of us — new viruses have many to choose from.\n",
    "The inserted piece of viral DNA or RNA then hijacks the human cell and forces it to make copies of the virus. The human cell makes many copies before it eventually dies and releases all of the newly made viruses. The new viruses are inert. They just float around in your blood stream, or climb aboard the spittle launching pad for an inter-host joy ride, until they find another cell to hijack.\n",
    "CoVID-19 actually has two names. It was given a formal name using international conventions that go like this. CoVID-19 is in the class of viruses known for having “crowns” on the surface of their envelopes. The first definition of the Latin word “corona” is crown — the second definition is “beer with lime”. It was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. So, its formal name according to convention is, “Corona Virus Identified in 2019”. That name was too long and no one liked saying it, so it was given the nickname, “CoVID-19”, that we all use today.\n",
    "CoVID-19 is related to the virus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003/2004. That virus had the name, CoV-SARS, which stood for “Corona Virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome”. CoVID-19’s other name is “CoV-SARS-2”, but no one uses it.\n",
    "Our principle exposure to CoVID-19 is coming into close contact with an infected person. Typically, you are exposed when someone close to you (as in proximity, not as in relationship) coughs or sneezes either directly on you, your clothing, or on a surface that you later touch like your iPhone. Viruses in dried spittle from an infected person can be found on kitchen counters, doorknobs, telephones, light switches, water faucets, handrails, computer keyboards etc. The exact amount of time the virus can survive in dried spittle is unknown. Data suggests it can survive from 2 to 7 days. Viruses cannot penetrate your skin. You become infected when you touch the contaminated surface and CoVID-19 takes a joy ride on your finger or hand until you touch exposed body tissue, typically on your face like rubbing your eyes, poking your nose, or using your fingernail to get that piece of orange pulp stuck between your teeth. I’ll say it again. The most frequent form of virus transmission is by getting coughed or sneezed on, and data suggests that you can get infected from touching a contaminated surface for up to 7 days after the surface became contaminated.\n",
    "Once transferred to your body tissue, the virus spreads throughout your body and implements a Dr. Evil-like master plan to enslave your cells and force them to make many copies of the virus. That is right, think of many “Minnie Me” evil doers.\n",
    "Viruses have been around through all recorded human history. They are a human parasite. They are extremely complex and reproduce by varied and intricate strategies. If we were to anthropomorphize viruses, we would conclude that they are extremely intelligent or clever. Some viruses, such as HIV, incubate for years inside their host before the host becomes sick. Some goofy viruses, like common measles (Rubeola) and German measles (Rubella) are totally not sticky and infect other hosts as aerosols (i.e., floating on the air). When an infected person sneezes, the virus and the spittle are injected into the atmosphere. Rubeola, being a non-sticky virus jumps off of the spittle and floats on the air until someone comes into contact with it. It can stay suspended for a fairly long period of time — like days. On rare occasions people have been infected by walking into a closed room where an infected person sneezed two days before they entered the room.\"\"\"                \n",
